            <h1>The Beginning</h1>
            <p>I first saw code during the Myspace era. This is also where I got my
                start in graphic design. I taught myself photoshop and started designing layouts,
                flyers, and profile pictures.</p>

            <h2>High School Days</h2>
            <p>I went to Brewbaker Technology Magnet High School (a.k.a. Brewtech) in Montgomery, Al.
                This is where I picked the graphic design academy in 10th grade and further expanded my knowledge of
                design. Unfortunately, between a complex competitive gymnastics and travel volleyball schedule, coding
                got left behind.

            <h1>Go to College, they said.</h1>
            <p>I went to the University of Montevallo and got a B.A. in Fine Art with a concentration in graphic design
                and a minor in Deaf Studies. I graduated in May 2016 and worked as an interior designer for 5 months.

            <!-- Talk about post college life. -->
            <h4>Congrats Grad! Now what?</h4>
            <p>My idea for post-college life was to be a graphic designer. This ultimately happened, but not right
                away. First, I kept my two part-time jobs as a Copy and Print Specialist and Staples and a gymnastics
                coach
                alongwith an unpaid internship with the company I currently work for today.
                After about 6 months I accepted a job as an interior designer. Hated it. I never want to talk to that
                many people again within a month in my life. Eventually I was offered the Art Director position at the
                agency where I held an unpaid internship for about a year. I still work there today.</p>

            <h5>More Life (Drake said that)</h5>
            <p>I am one designer of two at the agency. For a little more than a year I was the only designer and
                occasionally had
                the help of a few interns. Glad I have a cohort now! In my spare time I workout a lot..like a lot a
                lot.
                I also take commissions under my own brand, EllPea Designs (for pronunciation purposes --> LP Designs).
                I paint using watercolor and acrylics, make digital illustrations, invitations, flyers, logos, etc.
                While I enjoy what I do, I would like more of a challenge as I think I will feel more fulfilled that
                way.
                This is why I am excited to participate in Covalence!

            <h6>Adulting 101</h6>
            <p>One day I hope to be a successful self-sustained artist. My artist friend and I often discuss opening a
                business
                that will serve as a gallery while we also take painting commissions, hold painting parties, mentor
                youth
                in art, graphic design commissions and hopefully developing services too. Only time will tell!

                Earth is supposed to end as we know it, thanks to a asteroid. But with the help of an unusual crew of
                space amateurs we will all live to see
                another day. Armageddon is full of corny jokes, snide remarks, funny statements, and sad moments that I
                never get tired of seeing.
